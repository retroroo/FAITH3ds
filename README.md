# Faith3ds
 Faith recreation in unity 5.6 for 3ds homebrew


# I want to playtest!
See releases tab for .cci emulation files.

If you want to playtest on 3ds hardware, you can compile a .cci to a .cia with godmode9 on your own 3ds. I dont have a 3ds so I am unable to at this moment.



# I want to contribute
Follow one of the 3D Unity tutorials available. Once downloaded, simply clone the repo and begin. Here is a good one:

After this, it is the same as normal unity. Please work within the 3ds constraints. For this specific project I want to try my best to keep it compatible with o3ds.


# That seems hard, how else can I help?
I refuse to accept donations until the game is released, until then please bug me to finish it. Im known for procrastinating, and knowing a game is wanted motivates me.
