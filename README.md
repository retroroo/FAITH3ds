# NOTICE
WORK ON THIS WILL BE DELAYED TO FAVOR FAITHGBA. IF THIS HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT I WILL RESUME DEVELOPMENT.


# Faith3ds
 Faith recreation in unity 5.6 for 3ds homebrew


# I want to playtest!
See releases tab for .cci emulation files.

If you want to playtest on 3ds hardware, you can compile a .cci to a .cia with godmode9 on your own 3ds. I dont have a 3ds so I am unable to at this moment.



# I want to contribute
Follow one of the 3D Unity tutorials available. Once downloaded, simply clone the repo and begin. Here is a good one:

DIMOBLADE has good tutorials on youtube as well. He is very helpful on his discord.


After this, it is the same as normal unity. Please work within the 3ds constraints. For this specific project I want to try my best to keep it compatible with o3ds.


# That seems hard, how else can I help?
There are support links in my profile. Im known for procrastinating, and knowing a game is wanted motivates me. Sharing this project on social media would also help.

Many thanks
